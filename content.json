Angle: angle between and has 2 Matrics Elimination2.1 Matrix Rows and Columns: We called a 3 by 2 () matrix. With rows and columns. Multiplication: If , then Identity Matrix: , 2.2 Elimination : Upper Triangular System, All for . : Lower Triangular System, All for . : Elimination matrix, , In , we riqure and Example: Augmented Matrix: Elimination of Augmented Matrix: , 3 Inverse &amp; Transpose3.1 Defination Inverse For a square matrix , inverse matrix or If have an , then A is invertible / non-sigular, or A is sigular. For square , Transpose ’s row is same as ’s column 3.2 Calculate Gauss-Jordan Elimination For , make an Augmented Matrix with , make elimination to Example: Do Gauss Elimination to: Do Jordan Elimination to: So 4 Space4.1 Definition All linear combination of all vectors in Space(or Subspace) will still in Space(or subspace). , We called is a subspace of , obviously. The Space consists of all vectors with components , for any ,. can be space or subspace. Point in any Space and any Subspace 4.2 Span The space is by all linear combination of these vectors, it must be or a subspace of Example: 4.3 independence, basis, rank and dimension Linear independent: for any with basis: basis are linear independent. Basis is not unique. rank Defination: The rank of is the number of pivots. This number is / / . Also the dimension of and . () Pivots and Free variables: For : The numbers of Pivots = The numbers of Free variables = dimension: has dimension 4.4 Spaces of Matrix Example: : Column Space of A : Row Space of A : Nullspace of A All solutions to : Left Nullspace of A All solutions to For , 4.5 Solve First, solve : Reduced Row Echelon form has all pivots = , with zeros above and below We can use Elimination or to solve it.
